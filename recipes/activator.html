    <h2>What is 'slime activator' and why do I need it?</h2>
        <p>Slime activator is a liquid solution that you mix into glue or other slime bases to make it into slime. The activator reacts with the ingredients to make it all stretchy and slimy.
            <br>Common activators contain the element, <strong>boron</strong>. Therefore when choosing your activator or making one at home, be on the lookout for ingredients starting with “bor,” such as boric acid, sodium borate, or borax.
        </p>
    <h2>So what can I use as a slime activator?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Borax: Dissolve 1 teaspoon of Borax in 1 cup of water. <strong>Note:</strong> you can experiment with the ratio of Borax to water. A lower Borax to water ratio makes a thinner, slimier slime. A higher Borax to water ratio makes a rubbery, less stretchy slime.</li>
            <li>Liquid Starch</li>
            <li>Contact Solution (make sure the ingredients 'Boric Acid' or another ingredient containing 'BOR' in the spelling.)</li>
            <li>Laundry Detergent (again, check ingredients)</li>
            <li>Elmer's (and other brand) pre-made slime activator</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>How to use it</h2>
        <p>With most slime recipes - the amount of slime activator you need varies and will be dependant on the consistency you want. When adding slime activator it's best to add small amounts at a time - usually 1/2 to 1 tablespoon. Once you add your activator, start mixing. If your slime is too sticky and goopy - start the process again until you get the consistency you're happy with. </p>
    <h2>What if I add too much?</h2>
        <p>If you've added too much activator and you're left with a rubbery glob that breaks apart when you stretch it, no worries. I've found that you can add a little water to get it back to the stretchy consistency that slime is supposed to be. <strong>Note:</strong> after adding water, it will take quite a bit of mixing to get it looking and feeling like slime again. At first it will look like you completely ruined your slime. The bowl will be filled with broken chunks of slime floating around. This is normal - don't give up - after quite a bit of mixing and smushing - you will have slime again.
