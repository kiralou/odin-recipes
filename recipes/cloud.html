            <h2>How to make cloud slime</h2>
            <p>*The key to making cloud slime is using <strong>Instant Snow</strong> (you can find it on Amazon). Different brands may have different instructions. We need 1 tablespoon of instant snow for this recipe.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Pour <strong>glue</strong> into bowl</li>
                   <li>Mix in the slime <strong>activator</strong> with a spoon until the slime starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl. (You can make your own <a href="./activator.html">slime activator</a> or buy it at the store.)
                    <br><strong>Tip:</strong> Only add about a teaspoon of activator at a time.</li>
                    <li>Gradually mix the instant snow into the slime, then stretch and fold over the slime to mix it in. </li>
                    <li>Add a few drops of blue food coloring (or whichever color you’d like).</li>
                   <li>Continue to stretch the slime for several minutes. After 10-15 minutes you’ll have a fluffy slime that forms strings when you slowly stretch it.
                    <br><strong>Tip:</strong> If your slime feels too dry you can add a little water. If it’s too sticky, add a wee bit of slime activator.</li>
                    <li>Let it rest - Cloud slime is always better the next day. Put it in an airtight container (like this one) and let it rest over night. The next day it will be even softer and fluffier.</li>
                </ol>
            <h2>Enjoy!</h2>
