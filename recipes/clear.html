    <h2>A see-through goo that's clear as glass</h2>
    <p>This crystal clear slime is thick, moldable, and looks like liquid glass. It's simple to make, and fun to spice up with colors, scents, glitter, and more!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup <strong>clear glue</strong> (Elmer's is the best, but any clear glue with PVA wil do the trick</li>
        <li>1 cup <strong>water</strong></li>
        <li>slime <strong>activator</strong>*</li>
        <li>2 pumps <strong>foaming hand soap</strong> (must be clear or your foam won't be)</li>
        <li><strong>Mixing bowl</strong></li>
    </ul>
    <p>*when using contact solution as activator, you'll also want to mix 1 Tablespoon of baking soda in 1 cup of warm water. Stir this in with the glue before adding 2 Tablespoons of contact solution</p>
    <h2>Let's get started</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour (1) cup of <strong>clear glue</strong> into mixing bowl</li>
        <li>In another bowl, mix (1/2) teaspoon of <strong>Borax</strong> into (1) cup of <strong>warm water</strong> until diluted</li>
        <li>Slowly stir in the <strong>Borax solution</strong> with the <strong>clear glue</strong> with a spoon. It will start taking on a slime-like texture immediately. </li>
        <li>Stir until all liquid is absorbed. This can take a few minutes so be patient and keep stirring</li>
    </ol>
